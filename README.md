### Hashtag Analysis and Social Media Trends
This project is unique in that it offers filterable, multi-dimensional analysis of word and hashtag trends on a country and language basis, providing region specific insights. Unlike conventional trend analyzers, this project integrates engagement metrics (likes and shares) with text data to not only reveal popular words, but impactful ones as well. It also performs word co-occurrence analyses to uncover relationships between topics beyond their surface-level associations. Such an approach makes it useful for analyzing social media discourse in context with specificity.
